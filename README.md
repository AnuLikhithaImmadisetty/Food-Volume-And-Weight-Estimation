## Introduction

Accurately estimating the volume and weight of food items from images has applications in dietary assessment, nutrition tracking, and food portion control. This project utilizes deep learning models to perform these estimations based on input images. 

## Requirements

The code is written and tested in `python 3.6`. The required pip packages for running the volume estimation script are:

- `numpy==1.16.3`
- `pandas==0.24.2`
- `opencv-python==4.1.0.25`
- `scipy==1.2.1`
- `scikit-learn==0.21.1`
- `tensorflow==1.13.1`
- `keras==2.2.4`
- `h5py==2.9.0`
- `matplotlib==3.0.3`

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

After installing the required packages, install the project using the `Source Code.ipynb` script:

```bash
python Source Code.ipynb install
```
